# GitHub Actions Workflow Disabled
#
# Since you are using Vercel for deployment, this workflow is no longer needed.
# Vercel will automatically run `npm run build` (which includes `npm run fetch-data`)
# whenever you push to the repository.
#
# If you ever want to switch back to GitHub Pages, you can restore the content of this file.
